Some robots are designed to be human-like but are made to do things we cannot, such as jobs that would be too dangerous for humans to attempt. Robotics touches on a variety of fields such as medical, maintenance, travel, safety, and education.  The purpose is to improve on what we can already do whether it be by doing it longer, faster, more accurately or consistently by making them specific to on one task or multiple.

				<article>
					<p>Understanding how people think, feel, learn, and communicate allows employers fit employees to teams, understand what individual members require to be efficient, and ensure that meaningful work is distributed accordingly. A cheap and time-effective way to receive this information during the formative days of team creation is through personality tests such as Myers-Briggs or learning style tests. </p>
					<p>Phronesis Collective have a diverse range of scores personality test scores. There is an even mixture of assertiveness, leadership/followership, intuitiveness, and creativity. As individuals we learn, think and handle stress differently. We are from diverse backgrounds and regions throughout Australia that have come together to achieve a common goal. Should conflict resolution techniques be required, we should look to adapt our communication style to best suit the team member. We can obtain clues on how to achieve this through the personality test results provided.  </p>   
					<p>While group diversity is a benefit in creative thinking and problem solving, conflict is bound to arise. Understanding how the team members of Phronesis Collective think and interpret information in useful in warding off conflict and getting the most from all individuals and the team. Additionally, having a solid understanding how the individual thinks and feels will prepare them to contribute confidently to a group and seek the best from others.</p>

					<p>Phronesis Collective is made up of a good balance of assertiveness, leadership/followership, intuitiveness, and creativity. We are a dedicated, agile, and proactive group of members who came together to serve a common goal </p>
					<p>It was agreed by all Phronesis Collective members that we were committed to Assignment Two. We all actively contributed to meetings and tasks, readily taking on responsibilities as required. We performed solidly for the duration and consistently looked for ways to take our Project Plan to the next step. We actively engaged conflict management methods and mitigations before significant issue arose, sought out personal strengths and began to develop individual’s weaknesses.  </p>
					<p>After receiving pleasing feedback and scores for Assignment Two, Phronesis Collective is more determined than ever to get the best out of our individual learnings and implement them into Assignment Three and Assignment Five. We have elected to use Teams again for task management and have included the use of a live document, where members can brain-storm ideas and complete draft elements of the report as subjects are explored.   </p>

		<h2>Career Plans</h2>
		</center>
		<div id="techReport">
			<section>
				<article>
					<p>There are many similarities and differences that can be seen in our desired jobs and associated career plans. Soft skills such as excellent communication, ability to work under pressure, attention to detail, teamwork and problem-solving skills feature heavily through the IT industry. While each role requires some knowledge of programming and computing experience, they are all different in their individual requirements.  </p>
					<p>Some of the skills our group required are also in high demand, such as SQL, Javascript, while a few of our required skills are not in high demand, probably because these skills are prerequisite skills we yet to attain. This also outlined skill gaps in the industry and is worthwhile for our group to consider developing and attaining. One important lesson learnt is that we should know well of those commonly known skills and then aim to develop in a few specialized fields. </p>
					<p>While many of the skills and experiences are the same for each role, there are differing educational prerequisites to get into our chosen professions: </p>
					
					<p>Peta’s ideal job as a Data Scientist. This is a large sector. To become a Data Scientist, she must first have a bachelor's degree in computer science or related degree, focussing on Statistics (Inferential and Descriptive Statistics) and Mathematics (Linea Algebra and Calculus). </p>
					<p>Stephen’s ideal job is as a UX Designer. There are no formal pathways into this industry, though an appreciation of human behaviour and an attention to detail and design is an advantage. To take his career to the next level, Stephen may consider completing a Graduate Certificate of US and Web Design (SEEK 2022). </p>
					<p>Jacob’s ideal job as a Software Developer. To achieve this, he must have a bachelor's degree in computer science or related degree and must be a full-stack developer and understand concepts of software engineering (Beterteam 2022). </p>
					<p>David’s ideal job would be in tech support and a game developer. It would be common for game companies to require a Bachelor’s degree, but this is typically a negotiable element if the candidate has job experience (Bay 2022). </p>
					<p>Ben’s ideal job is Robotics Engineer, in which he will require a degree in automation, mechanical, robotics, or electrical engineering (Beterteam 2022). </p>
