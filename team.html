		<div class="subheader">
		<p>Understanding how people think, feel, learn and communicate allows employers to best fit employees to teams, understand what members need to be efficient, and ensure that meaningful work is distributed accordingly.</p>
		<p>A cheap and time-effective way to receive this information during the formative days of team creation is through personality tests such as Myers-Briggs or learning style tests.</p>   
		<p>Test results show that Phronesis Collective are a diverse selection of individuals. We learn, think and handle stress differently. We are from diverse backgrounds and regions throughout Australia that have come together to achieve a common goal.</p>
		<p>While diversity in thinking is a benefit in creative thinking and problem solving, understanding how team members think and interpret information in useful in warding off conflict and getting the most from the individuals. Additionally, having a better understanding how the individual best works prepares them to contribute confidently. </p>
